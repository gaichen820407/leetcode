(keyword)

Eg.
public
class
static
void
new

=>Keyword in java means reserved words, they have some special meaning in this programming language by default.

  (Java have 50 keywords)

public : the modifier(修飾子) for permission, we can access public content anywhere

class : the keyword when you want to define a class
(Java is OOP language, the development process in Java is designing and planning the object. So Java programming at least has a class.)

static : can use the class name to access this static method, for JVM execute JAVA programming.

void : when the method won't return any value, we should use this keyword to define


new : create a new object. (Java is the strong typing(強型態) language, we should declare the variable before we use it

=>Eg. Object o=new Object() the Object() is the Object class' constructor(建構子), convert the class to object by constructor



------------------------------------------------------------Basic conception------------------------------------------------------------

Object's field need effective encapsulation(封裝), or might have trouble in the developemnt later.

So, when class should declare fields are private, only the same class can access it,

and we also need the public method setter & getter method. The setter for defining fields, the getter for getting the fields' value.
